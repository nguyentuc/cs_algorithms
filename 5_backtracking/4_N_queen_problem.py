# The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard
# so that no two queens attack each other

# The expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed

# naive algorithm
# Generate all possible configurations of queens on board and print a configuration that satisfies the given constraints

# backtracking algorithm
# The idea is to place queens one by one in different columns, starting from the leftmost column
# When we place a queen in a column, we check for clashes with already placed queens
#  In the current column, if we find a row for which there is no clash, we mark this row and column as part of the solution
# If we do not find such a row due to clashes then we backtrack and return false.

# giai thuat
# 1. Start in the leftmost column
# 2. If all queens are placed then return True
# 3. Try all rows in the current column
# Do following for every tried row
# - (a) if the queen can be placed safely in this row then mark this [row, column] as part
# of the solution and recursively check if placing queen here leads to a solution
# - if placing the queen in [row, column] leads to a solution then return true
# - if placing queen doesn't lead to a solution then unmark this [row, col] (backtrack)
# and go to the step (a) to try other rows
# 4. If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger backtracking

# Python3 program to solve N queen problems using backtracking
